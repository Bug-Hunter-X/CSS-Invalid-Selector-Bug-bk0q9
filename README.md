This repository contains a demonstration of a rather uncommon CSS bug involving an invalid selector that prevents styles from being applied correctly. The bug.css file showcases the erroneous code, while bugSolution.css provides the corrected version. The issue arises from either a typographical error in the selector or the use of a selector that isn't part of the HTML structure. This leads to the associated styles being ignored by the browser. This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing CSS selectors to ensure they are valid and correctly target the intended HTML elements.
